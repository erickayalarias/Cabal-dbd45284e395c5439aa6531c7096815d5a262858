## Introduction

As our team's final project for the Master in Computer Science at Assembler Institute of Technology, we decided to create a Social Network based on Vimeo/Spotify.

We could use the technology which we thought is the most convenient as long as Laravel and Mongo were included.

Taking that into account, our website is based on the following aspects:

- 1 → Anonymity. You can only access it if you have a Blockchain wallet.

- 2 → Encryption. End-to-end encrypted chat. Encrypted post descriptions based on your friendships and encrypted communities for those who are not part of them.

- 3 → NFT. All music is transformed into NFT's that reside in a Testnet integrated in Blockchain.

## Getting Started

If you want a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Feel free to clone the repository.

### Prerequisites

If you want to use this application and customize it you will need to install:

- Node.js
```
https://nodejs.org/es/download/
```

- Sass:
```
npm install -g sass
```

All the customize features are implemented with Sass. Taking that into account, you will need to understand how to compile the Sass code into Css.

If you use the main structure implemented in this repository, just introduce the following code in the Terminal:

```
sass --watch assets/scss/index.scss:assets/css/index.css
```

To install all dependencies, even those which belong to React 17 : 
```
npm i --force 
```
